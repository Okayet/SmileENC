# SmileENC
Mathematical Encryption system called smile to communicate anonymously without the government knowing.

How to use: (unix: python3 script_name.py) (windows: run with python 3, from terminal: python3 script_name.py)
the smile enc system was created only to upgrade the encryption used on the script called sentenceENC.py so using smile.py u add chances of ur messages being un-decryptable. with the key u got from sentenceENC.py (example:11121221221) is the most important key without this key the numbers encrypted would be close to impossible to decrypt  but also sending these keys would give no advantage to people trying to expose u since the keys u created in smile.py script, but i would suggest using netcat to send these keys to ur friends or so ofc for the (11121221) keys so the messages will be 100% un-decryptable and remember to use netcat u need to find trustworthy people but u can find different ways around this problem, modify it however u would like.

Overview:
Anonymous Secure Chat is a powerful and user-friendly encryption tool designed to ensure secure and private communication between users. This open-source project empowers individuals to have confidential conversations without the fear of unauthorized access to their sensitive information. With customizable layers of encryption, the system provides robust protection against brute force attacks and unauthorized decryption attempts.

Use: to use this tool the main tool named (smile.py) u need to encrypt the sentences with the other tools that are below and to decrypt the encrypted messages someone sent please use the decryption tool inside the smile.py (main script) the encryption system is impossible to decrypt due to the large numbers it creates also the key created in the output the script is safe to use if u have any issues please report them. and ill try to fix them.

Needed: if u guys repost this tool please make sure to give credits to the owner or so called the creator, thank you. (give credits by putting: Okayet/Smile)

Key Features:

Layered Encryption: The system allows users to apply multiple layers of encryption, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized parties to break through the encryption barriers. Users can freely choose the encryption algorithms and keys to create their unique security configurations.

End-to-End Encryption: All communications are end-to-end encrypted, meaning the messages are only accessible to the intended recipients. The system ensures that even the service provider cannot access the contents of the messages exchanged between users.

Perfect Forward Secrecy: Each conversation session generates unique encryption keys, ensuring that compromising one session does not jeopardize the security of past or future communications.

User Anonymity: The system does not require users to disclose their real identities or personal information. Instead, users can communicate using anonymous handles or pseudonyms.

Message Deletion: Users have the option to set messages to self-destruct after a specific period, further protecting their privacy and reducing the risk of data exposure.

Open-Source: The entire codebase is open-source, encouraging transparency and peer review to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.

Disclaimer:
While this encryption system provides robust security measures, it is essential to remember that no encryption method is entirely foolproof. Users should exercise caution and avoid sharing sensitive information with untrusted parties. The system should not be used for malicious purposes or to encrypt data belonging to others without their consent.

Contributing:
Contributions to this project are highly appreciated! Developers can help improve the encryption algorithms, UI/UX, documentation, or report and fix bugs. All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's code of conduct and prioritize user privacy and security.
if u have any ideas write it down on fix/bug section so i can imporve the script by ur needs.

Disclaimer:
Please use this encryption system responsibly and ethically. The project maintainers and contributors disclaim any responsibility for the misuse or illegal use of this tool by any individual or entity.
